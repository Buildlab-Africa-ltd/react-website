              <p>The program was such a great one, I met great minds, learnt from them and I am
                   glad I could network with other people in the tech world through this program. I
                   was able to do a team work in solving user problems and that one great thing I am
                   grateful for. Thank you BuildLab Africa</p>

              <p>The most interesting part of this program is that it walked us through the actual
                   process of building products by building teams of people with different
                   complementing skills. It was a great experience and I am glad I got the oppurtunity to be a part of it.  I am ready for the
                   world. Thank you BuildLab Africa.</p>

              <p>This was intuitive, I was able work with other developers and come up with a
                   great product and see it go live. BuildLab Africa is a great platform for young people to learn and grow. I was
                     able to learn a lot from the program and I am glad for the opportunity. Thank you BuildLab Africa.</p>

                  <p>I love the vibe and the sync between the product manager, product designer
                   and developer. It really made me understand to work with a cross functional
                   team and that has given me the idea of what it's like working in my role. The
                   mentors are worldclass and their feedbacks gave us more clarity</p>
